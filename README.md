# Evaluation of Multi-Layer Perceptron Algorithm : Digit Dataset

## Background
This project aims to evaluate the accuracy prediction of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm when applied to the digits dataset. The digits dataset is a collection of 1,797 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each represented by an 8x8 pixel grid. This dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning, making it an excellent tool for benchmarking and comparing the performance of various models.

## Libraries and Versions
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- SeaBorn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Insights
- **Model Accuracy**: The MLP algorithm demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the handwritten digits, showcasing its effectiveness in classification tasks.
- **Training Process**: The training process included data normalization and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring a robust evaluation framework.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.
- **Visualization**: Sample images and predictions were visualized to give a clear representation of the model's ability to recognize digits.
